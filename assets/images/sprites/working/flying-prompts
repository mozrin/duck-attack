I need to generate a sprite sheet made up of a duck in flight towards the SOUTH (down)

High quality, high resolution

The wing movement should be logical and realistic to simulate flight.

Perspective: Top-down 2D Game View. The user is looking down at the phone screen.

- SOUTH means flying from the TOP of the screen to the BOTTOM of the screen.
- The camera sees the TOP of the duck (Head, Back, Wings).
- We should NOT see the duck's chest or belly (unless angled).
- Motion is strictly vertical (Y-axis) on the screen.

Animation Cycle (3 frames):

1. Wings High.
2. Wings Level.
3. Wings Low.

Other Constraints:

1. No shadow under the duck.
2. Background is transparent.
3. Style: Identical duck to provided example pictures, except IN FLIGHT
    a. ONLY 3 frames.
    b. Duck is in flight.

Anatomy Constraints:

1. Duck only has two wings
2. Ducks only have two feet.
3. Feet are tucked under the tail.

Save this created image in the assets/images/sprites/duck/fly folder
